# Cartoonisation in Neuroprosthesis: Exploring Cartoonisation to reduce neuro over-stimulation 

----

Source code for a Cartoonisation technique that makes use of the Opencv library. Cartoonisation is very important in image processing, especially in neuroprosthesis, as it is important to avoid over-stimulation so that the brain can process the data. 

### Cartoonisation: 

Cartoonisation works by recognising boundaries so that an image can be segmented and individual objects can be identified. This is important in neuroprosthesis as there is a trade-off for importance, meaning that certain objects must be detected and others can be disregarded.
